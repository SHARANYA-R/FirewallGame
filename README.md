# Firewall Placement Game

A modern web-based educational cybersecurity game that combines the classic N-Queens problem with network security concepts.

## Game Overview

The Firewall Placement Game challenges players to strategically place firewalls on a network grid to achieve complete security coverage. Using the mathematical constraints of the N-Queens problem, players must ensure that no two firewalls conflict with each other while maximizing network protection.

## Features

- **Interactive Grid-Based Gameplay**: Click to place and remove firewalls on a dynamic network grid
- **Multiple Difficulty Levels**: Choose from 4x4 (Beginner) to 10x10 (Expert) grid sizes
- **Real-Time Visual Feedback**: See protected zones, vulnerable areas, and conflicts instantly
- **Educational Elements**: Learn cybersecurity concepts through strategic gameplay
- **Hint System**: Get suggestions for optimal firewall placement
- **Auto-Solve Feature**: Watch the algorithm demonstrate optimal solutions
- **Responsive Design**: Play on desktop, tablet, or mobile devices
- **Accessibility**: Keyboard shortcuts and screen reader support

## How to Play

1. **Choose Your Network Size**: Select from 4x4 to 10x10 grid sizes in the difficulty selector
2. **Observe Region Colors**: Each colored region represents a different network segment
3. **Place Firewalls**: Click on network nodes to place firewalls (represented by üõ°Ô∏è)
4. **Follow N-Queens Rules**: Firewalls cannot be placed on the same row, column, or diagonal
5. **Secure All Regions**: Each colored region must have exactly one firewall
6. **Achieve Perfect Coverage**: Complete the puzzle with optimal firewall placement

## Game Rules

- **Firewall Constraints**: No two firewalls can attack each other (N-Queens rules apply)
- **Region Coverage**: Each colored region must have exactly one firewall
- **Victory Condition**: Secure all regions with optimal firewall placement
- **Scoring System**: Higher scores for efficient placement and complete coverage

## Visual Elements

- **üõ°Ô∏è Firewalls**: Green cells with shield icons
- **Colored Regions**: Different network segments with distinct colors and numbers
- **Protected Zones**: Areas secured by firewall coverage (green highlights)
- **Vulnerable Zones**: Unprotected areas (orange highlights)
- **Conflicts**: Red highlighting when placement rules are violated
- **Hints**: Blue highlighting for suggested placements

## Controls
